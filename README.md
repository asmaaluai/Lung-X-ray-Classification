# Lung-X-ray-Classification

## Introduction
The early and accurate detection of lung diseases is crucial in clinical practice to ensure timely medical interventions. In this project, we aim to leverage deep learning techniques to build a robust image classification model that can diagnose lung conditions using chest X-ray images.

## Dataset Description
The Lung X-Ray Dataset is a synthetically augmented collection of chest X-ray images, classified into 9 categories based on the most relevant characteristics. These categories include:

Normal
- Inflammatory Processes (e.g., pneumonia)
- Higher Density (e.g., pleural effusion, atelectasis, empyema)
- Lower Density (e.g., pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum)
- Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (e.g., emphysema, bronchiectasis)
- Degenerative Infectious Diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, fibrosis)
- Encapsulated Lesions (e.g., abscesses, nodules, tumors)
- Mediastinal Changes (e.g., pericarditis, lymph node enlargement)
- Chest Changes (e.g., malformations, hypoplasia).

The dataset is anonymized, ensuring no patient information is exposed, and has been verified by radiologists. It is provided for academic and research purposes, offering a valuable resource for exploring lung disease detection and classification tasks. The augmentation process ensures balanced classes and increased variability, improving model robustness.
